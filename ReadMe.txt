    ## Introduction
    Welcome to the Popaccs Guide! This program is designed to help you efficiently manage and utilize popaccs (open accounts) for various purposes. Whether you're automating account creation, managing proxies, or ensuring secure operations, this guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get started and make the most out of the tool.

    ## Prerequisites
    Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
    - **Python 3.7+** installed on your system.
    - **pip** package manager for installing dependencies.
    - A **Twitter Developer Account** with necessary API credentials.
    - A **proxies.txt** file containing your proxy servers.
    - Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

    ## Installation
    Follow these steps to install and set up the Popaccs program:

    1. **Clone the Repository**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/popaccs.git
        cd popaccs
        ```

    2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    3. **Install Dependencies**
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    4. **Configure Environment Variables**
        - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
        - Add your Twitter API credentials and any other required variables:
            ```
            TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
            TWITTER_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
            TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
            TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret
            ```

    ## Getting Started
    After installation, you're ready to start managing popaccs.

    1. **Prepare Your Proxies**
        - Ensure your `proxies.txt` file is populated with working proxy servers in the following format:
            ```
            http://username:password@proxyserver1:port1
            http://username:password@proxyserver2:port2
            ```
        - Avoid using proxies that are unreliable or banned by target platforms.

    2. **Run the Main Program**
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
        - The program will begin creating Twitter accounts using the provided details and proxies.

    ## Managing Popaccs
    Popaccs management involves creating, viewing, updating, and deleting open accounts efficiently.

    ### Creating a Popacc
    To create a new popacc:
    1. Open `main.py`.
    2. Define account details in the `accounts` list:
        ```python
        accounts = [
            {"username": "user1", "email": "user1@mailinator.com", "password": "Passw0rd!"},
            {"username": "user2", "email": "user2@mailinator.com", "password": "Passw0rd!"},
            # Add more accounts as needed
        ]
        ```
    3. Run the program, and it will handle account creation, email verification, and profile customization.

    ### Viewing Popaccs
    To view existing popaccs:
    - Access the `accounts` data structure or database where account information is stored.
    - Implement functions in `main.py` or a separate module to display account details as needed.

    ### Updating a Popacc
    To update account information:
    1. Retrieve the account details from storage.
    2. Modify the desired fields (e.g., username, email, password).
    3. Use provided functions to apply updates to the account via the Twitter API.

    ### Deleting a Popacc
    To delete an account:
    1. Access the account using its unique identifier.
    2. Use the `delete_account` function (to be implemented) to remove the account via the Twitter API.
    3. Remove the account from your storage/database.

    ## Advanced Features
    - **Proxy Rotation:** Automatically rotates proxies after each account creation to enhance anonymity.
    - **CAPTCHA Solving:** Integrates with 2Captcha service to solve CAPTCHAs encountered during account creation.
    - **Logging:** Detailed logs are maintained in `app.log` for monitoring and troubleshooting.
    - **Throttling:** Implements random delays between actions to mimic human behavior and avoid detection.

    ## Troubleshooting
    Common issues and their solutions:

    - **Proxy Errors:**
        - *Issue:* "Error getting proxy."
        - *Solution:* Ensure your proxies in `proxies.txt` are active and properly formatted.

    - **CAPTCHA Solving Failures:**
        - *Issue:* "Error solving captcha."
        - *Solution:* Verify your 2Captcha API key and check for any service outages.

    - **Authentication Errors:**
        - *Issue:* "Authenticated with Twitter API failed."
        - *Solution:* Double-check your Twitter API credentials in the `.env` file.

    - **Module Not Found:**
        - *Issue:* Missing Python packages.
        - *Solution:* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
